## Simple use case - Web testing

To show you how to set up a project using the jbehave-support library, I am going to make a test that Google searches `EmbedITCZ jbehave-support` and checks the result. To learn more about this example check out [Web-testing.md](jbehave-support-core/docs/Web-testing.md).

Of course you can use jbehave-support for much more than just selenium based testing. For example server communication ([SOAP](jbehave-support-core/docs/examples/Web-service.md), [REST](jbehave-support-core/docs/examples/Rest.md), [JMS](jbehave-support-core/docs/Jms.md)) or database manipulation ([SQL](jbehave-support-core/docs/Sql-steps.md)).

### Add to Java project as a Maven dependency

To add jbehave-support to a java project, just add [this](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jbehavesupport/jbehave-support-core) dependency to your pom.xml.
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jbehavesupport</groupId>
    <artifactId>jbehave-support-core</artifactId>
    <version>[current version number]</version>
</dependency>
```
Then build your project (`mvn clean install`) to download all the necessary dependencies.

Also, make sure to have the test resources setup correctly, simple setup to use can be like this:
```
<build>
    <testResources>
        <testResource>
            <directory>src/test/java</directory>
            <includes>
                <include>**/*.story</include>
                <include>**/*.table</include>
            </includes>
        </testResource>
        <testResource>
            <directory>src/test/resources</directory>
        </testResource>
    </testResources>
</build>
```

### Create a TestConfig configuration file

From this file, jbehave-support will take all the necessary information about tested applications and the types of reports you want.
First create a Java class and call it `TestConfig`. Add the spring annotation `@Configuration`.
```
@Configuration
public class TestConfig {
```
Setting up the application you want to test largely depends on what do you want to test. Generally, you need to add a Spring bean method setting up the necessary parameters. We will be setting-up a WebSetting for Selenium to access google.com. ([More](jbehave-support-core/docs/Web-testing.md#configuration) about setting up web testing)
```
@Bean
@Qualifier("GOOGLE")
public WebSetting google() {
    return WebSetting.builder()
          .homePageUrl("https://www.google.com")
          .elementLocatorsSource("home.yaml")
          .build();
}
```
The `@Qualifier` annotation sets up the name, under which we will be able to access this application in our `story`.

The `homePageUrl` method sets the url of the web applications home page.

The `elementLocatorsSource` methods sets the name of a [file](#create-a-ui-mapping-file) containing addresses of web page elements we want to interact with.

### Create a ui mapping file

In this yaml file, we need to setup the links to web page elements we want to interact with. It has to be placed in the resources directory, which is on one level above your main code directory:
- Project
    - src
        - main
            - java
                - your.main.code.directory
            - **resources**
                - home.yaml
        - test
            - java
                - your.test.code.directory
            
At this point, `your.main.code.directory` should contain the TestConfig class created previously.  
Note also the location of `your.test.code.directory` â€” this is where your story files will go later.


The links and names should be written like this:
```
home:
  search.button.css: "#tsf > div:nth-child(2) > div > div.FPdoLc > center > input[type='submit']:nth-child(1)"
  search.text.css: "input[type='text'][name='q']"
  search.output.css: "#rso > div:nth-child(1) > div > div.r > a > h3"
```
The title `home:` is the name of the page these elements can be found on.

Under the names `search.button`, `search.text` and `search.output`, we can use these elements in a story.

The `.css` extension tells the code, what type of address to look for. (Ex. `.xpath`)

The part after the colon is the address of the element itself.

[More](jbehave-support-core/docs/Web-testing.md#mapping-files) about ui mapping files

### Write your story

In your `your.test.code.directory` directory create a `.story` file. I will call it `Google.story`.

_(Optional)_ Inside, write the narrative, which should explain the purpose of this story. It has 3 mandatory parts: `In order to`, `As a` and `I want to`.
```
Narrative:
In order to try jbehave-support
As a confused human
I want to see if I can set it up
```
Then write your scenario:
```
Scenario: Open Google
Given [GOOGLE] homepage is open
When on [home] page these actions are performed:
| element       | action | data                      |
| search.text   | FILL   | embeditcz jbehave-support |
| search.button | CLICK  |                           |
Then on [home] page these conditions are verified:
| element       | property | data    | verifier |
| search.output | TEXT     | EmbedIT | CONTAINS |
```
This scenario opens `www.google.com`, writes `embeditcz jbehave-support` into the Google search bar. Clicks `search` and checks if the first result contains the text `EmbedIT`. Notice instead of lengthy element addresses, the element names defined in `home.yaml` are used.

[More](jbehave-support-core/docs/Web-testing.md#web-steps) about web testing steps for your story

### Write your story class

In the same directory as your `.story` file, create a Java class that extends `AbstractSpringStories` and call it `<yourStoryName>Story` (naming is important). Add the annotation `@ContextConfiguration(classes = TestConfig.class)` to link it with your TextConfig class. Leave this class empty.
```
@ContextConfiguration(classes = TestConfig.class)
public class GoogleStory extends AbstractSpringStories {
}
```
**This class is runnable. When you run it, it runs your story.**
