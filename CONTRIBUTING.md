# Contributors guide
We are happy You are considering contributing to jbehave-support! ðŸ˜ƒ

Before you start, please read this short guide, so You don`t get lost. If You have any questions, do not hesitate to ask either on Gitter or through GitHub issues.

## Dev environment
This project is written in Java 8, however we are aiming for Java 11 compatibility (CI tests are run against both). We are using the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA as an IDE. These are the plugins you need:
* SonarLint
* Spock Framework Enhancements
* GMavenPlus IntelliJ Plugin
* JBehave support
* Lombok

## Code
### Coding guidelines
1. Do not use asterisk imports (`org.springframework.beans.factory.*`)
2. If possible, use Lombok constructor injection
    * Do not use in groovy tests
    * Do not use for optional dependencies `@Autowired(required = false)`
    * Do not use in components which the user is expected to extend (e.g. `WebServiceHandler`/`RestServiceHandler`), to allow for simple constructor injection by users on their subclasses.
3. If possible, write [tests](#testing) for Your code.
4. Use SonarLint to prevent issues (delete unused imports etc.)
    
### Formatting
Please keep the coding style uniform. (In IntelliJ IDEA select the text You want to format and press `Ctrl+Alt+L` (Windows) or `Cmd+Alt+L` (Mac).)

## Documentation
For documentation we use .md files stored in `jbehave-support-core/docs` and public APIs are documented with JavaDoc. Sometimes, it is best to just show examples, as is the case with sample stories.

## Building the project with Maven
To build this project use the standard `mvn clean install`. We have 3 building profiles:
1. development
    * Build for contributors;
2. integration-test
    * Build for integration tests; Builds the app with all tests and runs them against test application backend (launched as part of the profile). 
3. release
    * Used for new version releases

## Testing
We write tests primarily in groovy (with the exception of Sample stories mentioned below). The tests are running against a mock aplication located in the `jbehave-support-core-test` folder. To start it run the `jbehave-support-core-test/jbehave-support-core-test-app/src/main/java/org/jbehavesupport/core/test/app/JbehaveSupportCoreTestApplication.class`.

Sample stories (`jbehave-support-core/src/test/groovy/org/jbehavesupport/test/sample`) are samples for users and tests at the same time.
